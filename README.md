# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze the Database for Pewlett Hackard to find information on the number of employees retiring in the future from all departments working in the company to better prepare and plan for hiring new staff, find replacements, and also prepare a mentoring program.  The ranges that were analyzed were employees with birthdates between 1952 and 1955.

## Results

* There are a large amount of people in senior positions and 
* A large amount of both senior engineers and engineers will be retiring
* There are many people eligible for the mentoring initiative to replace many of the out going employees
* With employees retiring and current employees taking those positions.  There will be large amounts of open positions.


## Summary
The company will see a large portion of their employees retiring and many of the current employees will need to be mentored into senior postions.  The company will also need to hire a large number of qualified people to replace a significant lost in their workforce.  The dynamics of the company will probably change as people are shifted and hired.
